React Timer

This is a simple React application that implements a timer functionality. When the "Start" button is pressed, the timer starts counting up by one every second. Pressing the "Stop" button pauses the timer, and the "Reset" button stops the timer and resets the count to zero.

Features:
- Start: Initiates the timer and starts counting up every second.
- Stop: Pauses the timer at its current count.
- Reset: Stops the timer and resets the count to zero.

Usage:
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Install the dependencies by running the command: `npm install`.
3. Start the development server with the command: `npm start`.
4. Open your web browser and access the application at http://localhost:3000.
5. Click the "Start" button to begin the timer.
6. Click the "Stop" button to pause the timer.
7. Click the "Reset" button to stop the timer and reset the count to zero.

This project is built with React and demonstrates how to handle state and create a simple timer functionality in a React component.
